# Web Filter Categories
This repository combines a number of trustworthy files into multiple, duplicate-free files that can be used with several open-source DNS filtering servers and web filtering applications to secure your network.

## What is DNS filtering?

DNS filtering is a security measure that uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to block access to malicious websites and filter out harmful or inappropriate content. When a user tries to access a website, their computer first sends a DNS request to a DNS server. The DNS server then translates the website's domain name into its corresponding IP address.

With DNS filtering, the DNS server can be configured to block access to certain websites or categories of websites. This is done by creating a blocklist of websites that are known to be malicious or inappropriate. When a user tries to access a website that is on the blocklist, the DNS server will return an error message, preventing the user from accessing the website.

## Why use DNS filtering?

### DNS filtering can be used to protect users from a variety of online threats, including:

### Malware: 
Malicious websites can be used to infect users' computers with malware, such as viruses, Trojans, and worms. DNS filtering can help to block these websites, preventing users from becoming infected.
### Phishing:
Phishing websites are designed to look like legitimate websites in order to trick users into entering their personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers. DNS filtering can help to block these websites, preventing users from being phished.
### Adult content:
DNS filtering can be used to block access to adult content, such as pornography and gambling sites. This can be useful for businesses that want to protect their employees from accessing this type of content on company-owned devices.
### Inappropriate content: 
DNS filtering can also be used to block access to other types of inappropriate content, such as hate speech and violence. This can be useful for parents who want to protect their children from this type of content.

## How does DNS filtering work?

DNS filtering works by using a DNS server that has been configured to block access to certain websites or categories of websites. When a user tries to access a website, their computer first sends a DNS request to the DNS server. The DNS server then checks its blocklist to see if the website is on the list. If the website is on the list, the DNS server will return an error message, preventing the user from accessing the website.

## How to set up DNS filtering?

Opensource DNS filtering servers are a great way to protect your network from malicious websites and inappropriate content. They are also a more affordable option than commercial DNS filtering services.

### There are a number of different opensource DNS filtering servers available, including:

### Pi-hole: 
Pi-hole is a popular opensource DNS filtering server that is easy to set up and use. It can be run on a Raspberry Pi or other small computer.

### CleanBrowsing: 
CleanBrowsing is another popular opensource DNS filtering server. It offers a wider range of features than Pi-hole, including the ability to block ads and trackers.

### Unbound: 
Unbound is a more advanced opensource DNS filtering server. It is not as easy to set up as Pi-hole or CleanBrowsing, but it offers more flexibility and control.
